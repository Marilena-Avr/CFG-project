                Nature and biodiversity are declining faster than at any other time in history, with successive major reports highlighting the huge scale of nature loss. 1 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction, many within the next few decades. The value per capita of the world’s natural capital stocks has declined by 40% since 1992. Meanwhile, climate change accelerates, with greenhouse gas emissions and average temperatures continuing to rise.  The two problems are interconnected and share the common drivers of inefficient, poorly governed natural resource use.

                Given the intimacy of their relationship, coherence between global targets for climate and biodiversity is of paramount importance. 2021 has been hailed as a ‘Super Year’ for the environment, with UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow setting new global climate goals, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 in Kunming doing the same for biodiversity. COP26 and COP15 need to coherently develop solutions and implementation plans for nature and biodiversity together: calls for action aiming to influence COP15 are equally relevant for the COP26 nature theme.

                To halt and reverse these catastrophic trends, it is essential that the root drivers are addressed - especially as doing so also brings opportunities and benefits including enhancing human health and wellbeing and creating green jobs. The way natural resources (land, biomass, fossil fuels, metals, minerals, and water) are managed has a big impact on the largest drivers of our most significant planetary challenges. Land use is a key example of natural resource management influencing both climate and biodiversity: not only is land use change the biggest driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss, an estimated 23% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in the last decade were from agriculture, forestry, or other land use.

                How can better natural resource management bring about a positive results for biodiversity, and therefore create the resilient natural world that is so crucial for managing climate change? The root drivers of nature destruction can be addressed through knowing the true impact of economic activities, bringing actors together to integrate competing needs into spatial plans, implementing nature-based and circular solutions, and recognizing nature’s true value.

                By knowing their true impact on nature, consumers, producers, investors, and policymakers can prioritize and incentivize sustainable models. Value chain transparency enables decision-makers to identify key points of intervention, where environmental impacts along the value chain caused by production and consumption can be reduced. Ideally, value chain transparency would be made a reality through strong scientific data and consistent international standards. These would incentivize producers to invest in traceability – knowing that the resulting transparency would be accepted by any country they wanted to import to.

            Technology is already improving transparency: satellite services are being used to trace the origins of cocoa in chocolate supply chains. Chocolate producers, such as Barry Callebaut, are using this information to reduce drivers of deforestation directly or indirectly associated with their supply of cocoa. As well as producers themselves, governments are also driving value chain transparency: for example, the German Federal Government intends to pass a supply chain act this year, requiring companies to meet due diligence standards on human rights and environmental impacts. This can drive investment: portfolios are taking an increasing interest in biodiversity but have found it difficult to invest directly because positive impacts are difficult to measure. The Zoological Society of London have developed an online platform to help with this: it details the activities of soft commodity producers, enabling proactive investors to avoid companies who have particularly damaging impacts, and to identify specific natural resource management strategies improving how activities like deforestation are managed. This tool is already being used by first-mover fund managers.

            Negotiators at Kunming and Glasgow should commit to finding mutually accepted science-based standards as soon as possible, for tracing biodiversity (and other) impacts through the value chain, so that policymakers, investors, entrepreneurs and consumers can support nature-positive products and services along entire value chains. COP26’s Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) initiative, which is bringing together diverse stakeholders in dialogue to accelerate sustainable production of forest commodities, represents a real opportunity for progress in this area and would be strengthen by a globally consolidated, science-based standard, for example based on the impact footprint methodology.

                Production can be made more sustainable through the implementation of nature-based and circular economy solutions – using nature’s inherent regenerative capacity to produce materials and enhance ecosystem services simultaneously. These practices avoid ecosystem degradation, minimize waste, and assist the recovery of ecosystem functions. One example is the planting of bamboo to support poverty alleviation; it re-greens degraded landscapes while providing livelihoods, shown by examples from diverse locations including China, Ethiopia, India, Ghana, and Tanzania. In Tanzania, over 1,000 jobs were created, bringing additional household income to communities.
                As well as being an important part of CBD’s proposed post-2020 targets, investing in nature-based solutions is a stated aim of COP26: parties can maximize the effectiveness of such investment by ensuring that natural resource management underpins planning of nature-based solutions.

                The intrinsic value of natural assets and the services they provide is not recognized by economic systems, and this contributes to the mismanagement of natural resources. Integrating nature into economic decision making is not the same as merely putting a price on nature; The Dasgupta Review, published earlier this year, makes the case for basing economic decisions on an inclusive measure of wealth, based on human, produced, and natural capital, thereby incorporating ecosystem extent and quality into central government decisions.

                Although instruments valuing ecosystem services are still relatively rare, there are an increasing number of examples. One such initiative is the Araguaia League in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Aiming to improve the region’s environmental assets, it financially compensates activities encouraging sustainable intensification of cattle production, including conservation, and emissions reduction.
                At COP26, and in coherence with CBD COP15, leaders need to capitalize on recent progress, which includes approval by the UN of a comprehensive framework for natural capital accounting (UN’s System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)). National governments should commit to using this internationally agreed statistical framework to increase the spread and depth of natural capital accounting around the world.
