                <h4>The Main Outcomes: States and Policy </h4>
                <p class="section-texts"> COP26 has been crucial in moulding the international focus and inter-state cooperation regarding the climate crisis. But has it been sufficient so far?
                </p>
                <p>International trade and multinational production of certain products are paramount contributors to carbon emissions. </p>
                <p>Therefore, any new policies regarding trade regulation are important to look into. </p>

                <p class="section-texts">The loss of biodiversity and the extinction of several species has been a great concern in the past century.
                    Between 1970 and 2014, the effects of global warming have been inextricably linked to the extinction of 4,000 species.</p>
                </p>
                <p>COP26 has the ability to call for more effective measures against the exctinction of thousands of animals.</p>
